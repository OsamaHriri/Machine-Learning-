# Titanic  :ship: :swimmer: - Assignment 03

Here we have the famous Titanic dataset with the question of who survives and who doesn't. link to the dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), here we were asked to: 
1. Get the data.
2. Explain the data using graphs, tables, and visualization algorithms. 
Process the data; clean, fill missing, remove irrelevant features, create new features from given ones, and so on.
4. Machine Learning - run the following
- Tree-based model.
- SVM.
- KNN.
- Neural nets.
- PCA.
- A method of your choosing.
- One unsupervised clustering algorithm.
5. Submit the results to Kaggle and compare between all models.

## What we did
Our workflow was the following:

## A Peek into the flow 

While trying to find relationships between features and weather the person survived or did not we built the following viz:

After processing the data we lowered it into 2D using PCA and plot it:

## Final Results
Comparing the final results of all the models we got the following accuracies:
