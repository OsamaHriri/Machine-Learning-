# Israel Elections :envelope: - Assignment 02

The 2019-2020 Israeli elections were repeated 3 times, here we have all three of those elections in the excel files where each one contains all the cities and number of votes it voted for each of the given party.
The notebook (or the extracted HTML) contains the following 6 sections: 
1. Importing the data.
2. Explain the data using graphs and tables.
3. Using two **Clustering** algorithms we looked for a correlation between the votes and the voters' demographic characteristics.
4. Using **Random Forest** we predicted the number of legal votes in Haifa, Elat, Sahneen, Ayelet Hashachar, and Katzrin in the last elections.
5. Using **Adaboost** we predicted the number of votes for the following parties: Likud, Rhema mshotefet, and Kahool Lavan in the following cities: Bni brak, Sahneen, Nazareth, Jeruzalem, Carmel, Dalet el-Karmel in the last elections.
6. Imagin the country has extra fundings and wants to place guards in cities that have a high number of illegal votes for the last elections, where should they place them?
